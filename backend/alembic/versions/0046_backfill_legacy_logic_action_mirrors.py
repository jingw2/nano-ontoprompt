"""Backfill v2 mirror rows for existing legacy Logic rules/Actions.

Revision ID: 0046_backfill_legacy_logic_action_mirrors
Revises: 0045_ontology_entity_search_depth
Create Date: 2026-09-11

Publication and the Agent tool catalog read only `v2_ontology_logic_rules`/
`v2_ontology_action_types` (see `app/services/publication/legacy_sync.py`
for why two tables exist and how the app now keeps them in sync going
forward for Logic rules/Actions created through the legacy `/logic`/`/actions`
API). Every such row created BEFORE that sync existed — in particular every
`simple_llm`-mode ontology's LLM-extraction-task rules, which have never had
a v2 counterpart at all — has no mirror row yet, so those ontologies' Agent
tool-binding UI shows zero Logic/Action tools no matter how many the
Ontology's own Logic/Actions tabs list. This one-time backfill creates the
missing mirrors so existing ontologies pick up the fix immediately, without
needing every row individually re-saved or toggled first.

`pipeline_mapping`-mode ontologies are a DIFFERENT case this must not touch:
`app/services/v2/mapping/mapping_service.py` already dual-writes each
discovered rule/action to BOTH tables directly (`_upsert_v1_logic` +
`_upsert_v2_logic`, `_upsert_v1_action` + `_upsert_v2_action`), under two
independently generated ids correlated only by matching `ontology_id`+name.
Backfilling by id alone (as an earlier version of this migration did) cannot
see that correlation and inserts a second, duplicate v2 row for every one of
those already-mirrored legacy rows. This version additionally skips a legacy
row whenever a v2 row already exists for the same ontology and name,
regardless of id.
